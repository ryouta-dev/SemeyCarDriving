class_name KudosTracker
extends RefCounted

## Scores how stylishly the car is being driven and accumulates a running "kudos"
## total — the game's fun metric. Cool moves (drifts, big air, near misses, fast
## clean driving) add kudos; mistakes (crashes, going off-road, flipping, spinning
## out) take it away.
##
## This is a pure data/logic helper with no knowledge of the physics body or the
## HUD. Each physics frame the car hands it a Telemetry snapshot (speed, slip
## angle, wheel contact, etc.); the tracker integrates that into a score and
## reports discrete "events" (named scoring moments) so the HUD can pop up
## "DRIFT! +120" style feedback. Keeping it standalone makes the scoring curve
## easy to tune and unit-test, and means the car/HUD never embed magic numbers.
##
## Sign convention: kudos is clamped at >= 0 (you can't go into debt). A combo
## multiplier rewards stringing cool moves together without a mistake; any
## penalty resets the combo.

## A single scoring moment worth showing the player, e.g. "DRIFT", "NEAR MISS",
## "CRASH". Emitted from update() so the HUD can flash a label. `amount` is the
## kudos delta already applied (positive = earned, negative = lost).

var drift_slip_threshold: float = 0.25
## Kudos per second of sustained drift, before the speed and combo multipliers.

## trickle). Scales with how close to top speed you are.

var near_miss_distance: float = 3.0
## Flat kudos awarded for a near miss (scaled by speed).

## Cooldown (s) after a near miss before another can fire, so one obstacle does
## not machine-gun rewards frame after frame.

## control. ~115 deg/s.
var spinout_yaw_threshold: float = 2.0
## One-off penalty when a spin-out is first detected. Kept modest: a spin is a
## loss of control but not a wreck, so it should sting without wiping a small
## score. A drift gone slightly too far shouldn't cost more than the drift earned.

## is treated as an impact.

## Crash threshold (m/s per frame) used while the driver is commanding braking
## (foot brake or handbrake). A locked-wheel handbrake stop decelerates hard

## alone can produce in a single frame, but below a real high-speed collision.
