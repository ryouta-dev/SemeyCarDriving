class_name StreetLampLights
extends Node

## The world's street lamps, switched on together after dark and off by day.
##
## This is the street-lamp counterpart to Headlights: a single component that
## owns one intent — set_on(true/false) — so the rest of the game never has to
## know how many lamps there are or how their glow is wired. The day/night
## controller decides *when* it's dark; this only knows how to be on or off.
##
## Unlike the car's headlights, street lamps don't live in a fixed scene subtree.
## They are placed per OSM tile and stream in and out as the car drives, so this
## controller can't just collect its lights once in _ready(). Instead each tile's
## OSMAssetPlacer registers its lamp lights here as the tile loads, and the
## controller drives every registered group from a single shared brightness level.
##
## That shared level is the crux: a tile that streams in at night must spawn
## already lit (not snap on a moment later), and a tile that streams in mid-fade
## must come up at exactly the fade's current brightness. New registrations are
## therefore applied at the live level immediately, and the global fade walks
## that level for everything at once.

## Seconds for the lamps to fade fully on or off. Slightly slower than the car's
## headlights so a whole street easing on reads as ambient dusk rather than a
## switch being thrown.
const FADE_TIME := 1.2

## One tile's worth of street-lamp lights. Holds the OmniLight3D point lights and
## the emissive bulb materials so both the cast light and the visible glow of the
## bulb pulse together. Kept as a plain bucket the placer fills and hands over.
class LampGroup:
	## The point lights that throw a pool of light on the road under each lamp.
	var lights: Array[OmniLight3D] = []
	## Per-bulb emissive materials, driven so the lamp head itself glows.
	var materials: Array[StandardMaterial3D] = []
	## Energy each OmniLight3D reaches when fully on (captured at register time so
	## the per-lamp authored brightness survives the global 0..1 fade).

	## Emission multiplier each bulb material reaches when fully on.
	var glow_energy: float = 0.0
	## Tint of this group's cast light and bulb glow, resolved from the lamp's OSM
	## tags (light:colour / lamp_type) at build time so a sodium street glows
	## orange while an LED street stays white. White by default.
