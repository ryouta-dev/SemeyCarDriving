## Turns a solved RoadJunctionSolverScript.Junction into actual scene geometry: the
## intersection surface, the kerb corners that wrap around it, and the painted
## stop bars on each approach.
##
## The solver decides WHERE everything goes (pure maths, exactly testable); this
## class decides how it is drawn (SurfaceTool, terrain draping, materials). The
## split keeps the hard geometry unit-testable without a scene, and keeps the
## Godot-specific mesh code out of the maths.
##
## ── What a junction is made of ───────────────────────────────────────────────
##   1. The CAP — a triangulated polygon covering the hole left by the trimmed
##      arms. Drawn as asphalt, terrain-draped like the ribbons so it sits flush.
##   2. KERB CORNERS — for each gap between two adjacent arms, a wedge of raised
##      pavement joining the two arms' kerb lines around the corner. Without
##      these, sidewalks stop dead at the intersection mouth in mid-air.
##   3. KERB RAMPS — where a kerb corner meets an arm, the pavement drops to
##      road level over a short run so the corner reads as a dropped crossing
##      rather than a cliff.
##   4. STOP BARS — a painted transverse bar across each approach, just inside
##      the cap. Explicit geometry (not shader UVs) because the cap has no
##      along/across parameterisation to paint into.

## Height the junction surface sits above the terrain. Slightly above the road
## ribbons (RoadProfileScript.ROAD_Y) so the cap always wins the coplanar contest at
## the mouth where the two meet, leaving no shimmer.
const CAP_Y := RoadProfileScript.ROAD_Y + 0.004

## Height of painted markings above the cap surface.
const PAINT_Y := 0.006

## Colour of road markings. Matches the asphalt shader's marking_color so paint
## on the cap and paint on the ribbons look like the same paint.
const MARKING_COLOR := Color(0.85, 0.82, 0.62)

## Depth (metres, along the approach) of the stop bar painted on each arm.
const STOP_BAR_DEPTH := 0.4

## Highway classes that carry a painted stop line where they meet a junction.
##
## Deliberately limited to through-roads. Service roads, driveways, alleys and
## living streets do not get a painted bar in reality, and drawing one on every
## arm of every junction turned each intersection into a ring of white blocks —
## far more visually prominent than the asphalt itself.

}

## Road-class ranking used to decide which arms of a junction must give way.
##
## A stop line marks a boundary a driver must yield AT, so it belongs only on
## the arms that actually yield. Painting one on every arm — which this builder
## used to do — states that all four approaches stop, which is not a junction
## that exists. It also tells the driver on the main road to give way to the
## side street they have priority over.
##
## Real priority comes from signage, which OSM records on NODES
## (highway=stop / highway=give_way) rather than derivably from the ways. Where
## those nodes exist the ribbon shader already paints the marking (see
## RoadMarkingSpec), so the cap does not need to guess. What is left for the cap
## is the unsigned junction, where priority follows road class: a residential
## street meeting a primary yields to it.

## Rank for a highway class not in CLASS_RANK. Below every named through-road so
## an unknown class is treated as minor and yields, rather than claiming a
## priority it may not have.
const DEFAULT_CLASS_RANK := 1

## How much higher-ranked another arm must be before this arm is marked as
## giving way to it.
##
## One full step. Equal-class arms (the classic residential + residential
## crossing) get NO markings at all, which is correct across most of Europe:
## such a junction is governed by priority-to-the-right / voorrang van rechts,
## an unmarked rule. Painting stop bars there is what made every suburban
## crossing read as a controlled intersection.
const YIELD_RANK_MARGIN := 1

## Width of the base of one shark's tooth, and the gap to the next, in metres.
## Both ~0.5 m per the Dutch RVV 1990 specification for marking B6.

## How far inside the cap mouth the stop bar sits, so it reads as being at the
## junction rather than floating in the middle of it.
const STOP_BAR_INSET := 0.5

## Length (metres) over which a kerb corner ramps down to road level where it
## meets an arm. This is the dropped-kerb / wheelchair ramp.
const KERB_RAMP_RUN := 1.2

## Points used to tessellate each Bezier kerb corner.
##
## The kerb corner is genuinely curved (a real kerb turns on a radius), unlike
## the asphalt cap beneath it, which is a straight-edged polygon. This used to
## borrow the solver's FILLET_SEGMENTS; that constant is now 0 because the cap
## has no arcs at all, so reusing it would silently flatten every kerb corner
## into a single straight chord.
