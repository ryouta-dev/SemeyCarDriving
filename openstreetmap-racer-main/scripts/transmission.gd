## Computes which gear a car is in based on its current forward speed.
##
## This is a pure data/logic helper with no knowledge of the physics body or the
## HUD — the car owns one of these and asks it "what gear am I in at X km/h?".
## Keeping it standalone makes the gear curve easy to tune and unit-test, and
## means the sound system can later read the same gear/RPM data without touching
## the physics code.
##
## Gear numbering convention used throughout the project:
##   -1 = reverse
##    0 = neutral (stationary / coasting through the clutch zone)
##  1..N = forward gears (N = forward_gear_count, default 6)

## Number of forward gears. A real car layout: 6 forward + 1 reverse.
const FORWARD_GEAR_COUNT := 6

## Special gear indices so callers don't pass around magic numbers.
const GEAR_REVERSE := -1
const GEAR_NEUTRAL := 0

## How much "taller" each successive gear is than the previous one. A real
## gearbox spaces ratios geometrically: 1st covers a narrow speed band for snappy
## launches, and each higher gear stretches over a wider band. A value of 1.0
## would give evenly-sized bands; >1.0 makes the lower gears progressively
## shorter and the top gears longer, which is what gives that familiar
## "quick through the low gears, long pull in top" feel.
var gear_spacing: float = 1.15

## Below this speed (km/h) the car is treated as in neutral so the HUD shows "N"
## instead of flickering into 1st while sitting still.
var neutral_speed_threshold: float = 1.0

## Upper speed boundary (km/h) of each forward gear, index 0 = 1st gear.
## Built once from max_speed; the last entry always equals max_speed.
var _upshift_points: PackedFloat32Array = PackedFloat32Array()

## The max forward speed (km/h) the bands were built for, so we can rebuild lazily
## if the car's max_speed is retuned at runtime.
var _built_for_max_speed: float = -1.0


## Recomputes the per-gear speed bands for the given top speed (km/h).
##
## The boundaries follow a geometric progression: the width of gear i is
## proportional to gear_spacing^i. We normalise those widths so the cumulative
## sum of all six lands exactly on max_speed_kmh, guaranteeing 6th gear tops out
## at the car's real maximum with no gaps or overlap.
