class_name TrafficManager
extends Node3D

## Spawns and manages a population of AI traffic cars around the player.
##
## Design goals (from the feature request):
##   * Cars drive along the OSM roads, flowing from one road onto a connected one
##     at shared junctions (a road *graph*, not isolated segments) so they don't
##     teleport between disjoint ways. A car that reaches the end of its road is
##     continued onto a road attached to that junction, keeping its speed.
##   * They don't need to be globally persistent — just consistently *present*
##     within a radius of the player. Cars are pooled; one that drifts out of
##     range, or hits a genuine dead end, is recycled onto a fresh nearby road.
##   * Cars in view get full physics (solid obstacles the player can hit); cars
##     out of view fall back to cheap kinematic motion to stay performant.
##   * The larger the street, the more cars — width-scaled capacity, decided by
##     TrafficRoadNetwork / TrafficSpawnPolicy.
##
## Composition: the scene wires `car_path` (the player) so the manager knows the
## center to keep traffic around, and it reads the OSM data from the tile manager
## via `tile_manager_path`. It builds the road network once the data is ready.

## How far from the player, in meters, to keep traffic populated. Roughly matches
## a couple of tile radii so cars exist a little beyond view and stream naturally.
@export var active_radius: float = 260.0
## Cars beyond this (a bit past active_radius, for hysteresis) are recycled onto a
## nearer road so the population follows the player without thrashing.
@export var recycle_radius: float = 340.0
## Hard cap on live AI cars. The single biggest performance lever; the spawn
## policy fills big roads first up to this budget.
@export var max_cars: int = 40
## Seconds between population refreshes (which roads are active, spawn/recycle).
## The per-frame driving still runs every physics frame; only the bookkeeping is
## throttled.
@export var refresh_interval: float = 0.75
## Distance (m) from the camera within which a car is treated as "in view" and
## upgraded to full physics. Slightly generous so cars are solid just before they
## enter the frustum.
@export var detail_distance: float = 90.0

## The player car (traffic centers on it, and it's excluded from detail checks).
@export var car_path: NodePath
## The tile manager to pull parsed OSM data from.
@export var tile_manager_path: NodePath

## How far the player must move from the last network-build center before the
## drivable graph is rebuilt around the new position. Keeps the graph following
## the player when streaming a country (where the whole map is never resident)
## without rebuilding every frame. Zero-cost on the single-file path too.
##
## Tuned against build_radius (~600 m): a larger threshold means successive
## rebuild regions overlap less, but every overlapping tile is now served from
## the shared parse cache, so a rebuild only pays for the NEW ring of tiles. At
## 200 m the recycle radius (340 m) still comfortably covers the gap travelled
## between rebuilds, so cars never reach an ungraphed edge. Rebuilds also run
## off-thread, so this only controls how often — not whether it stalls a frame.

# thread.
#
# It runs on a DEDICATED Thread, not WorkerThreadPool. A fresh region's collect
# cold-parses ~64 tile files serially (~870 ms); on the shared pool that one long
# task saturated the workers the engine + tile streaming also use, and the frame
