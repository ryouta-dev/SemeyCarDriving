class_name PostProcessing
extends Node

## Owns the screen-space post-processing stack on the WorldEnvironment and lets
## us switch individual effects on and off from code (no UI). This is the "make
## it look like Forza" layer: glow/bloom, SSAO, SSIL, SSR and tonemap/colour
## grading, all stacked on top of the existing sky + fog.
##
## Two design goals drive the shape of this file:
##
##   1. Per-effect toggles. Each effect is an exported bool so we can flip them
##      in the scene/inspector (or from a test harness) and measure where the
##      frame rate falls off. SSR and SSIL are the usual suspects, so being able
##      to disable them independently — without touching the others — is the
##      whole point. Flipping a toggle at runtime re-applies immediately.
##
##   2. Day/night awareness. Bloom and exposure want different values after dark:
##      at night the emissive headlights, street lamps and lit windows should
##      bloom harder against a darker frame, and the overall exposure lifts a
##      touch so the scene doesn't crush to black. We listen to the same
##      day_night signal the sky uses and re-apply on each transition, tweening
##      the continuous values so it matches the sky's 1.5 s crossfade.
##
## The Environment resource is shared with SkyController (which owns fog +
## ambient + the sky material). We only ever touch the post-processing fields
## here, so the two controllers can drive the same Environment without fighting.

## A resolved set of post-processing values for one instant in time. The two
## presets (day/night) are instances of this; the live state is lerped between
## them so a toggle mid-transition reverses smoothly. Only the *continuous*
## values live here — the on/off booleans are authored toggles, not animated.

## Daytime grade: neutral-to-slightly-punchy. Bloom is subtle — bright sky and

## contrast/saturation lift gives the warm, slightly graded Forza daylight look.

## Nighttime grade: bloom pushed hard and its HDR threshold dropped so the
## emissive lights (headlights, street lamps, lit windows) blaze against the
## dark frame. Exposure lifts slightly so shadows don't crush to pure black, and
## saturation eases off the way real low-light footage desaturates.
